--ABILITY DESC FORMATTING NOTES FOR WRITERS--

---Use red highlight on numbers, percentages and key combat concepts, ie, Attack, Dodge, Damage, Heal, Shield Segment, Runspeed, etc

---"Runspeed" is one word

---Anything within <#RED></> brackets should be capitalized as if a proper noun, ie <#RED>Damage</> :--VS--: <#RED>damage</>

---Try to keep numbers next to their associated nouns whenever possible, ie
-----"A <#RED>{percent}% Runspeed</> increase":--VS--: "A <#RED>{percent}%</> increase of <#RED>Runspeed</>"

--- If a description has too many elements to highlight, use best judgement to
--- choose the most important 3. Try to view the description in-game to help
--- prioritize

---End description sentences with a period
